                Hobbies and Interest
            </h3>

        <p>
            I love reading. It's like exploring the world in your comfort zone. I think reading enlightens and empowers. Because <abbr> Readers are learners</abbr>. 
        </p>
        <p>Over sixteen years of my life, I have read over a hundred books and that includes novels,storybooks,comic books,e-books. These list does not includes the compulsory books we were asked to buy in school</p>
        <p>
            I own about thirty plus novels in my bookshelf at home
        </p>
        <p>
            If a person can live reading, why won't he like writing also; I have written a copy of novels, storybooks and poems  just for fun
        </p>
        <p>
            I think writing on pen and paper is important because not only do I get used to writing, my handwriting improves and I remember more of what is written on paper and what is written on a laptop or Ipad. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I love nature and marvelling at God's arts and crafts, It is indeed mesmerizing and relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love content making. The addition of effects and filters on pictures and video clips is so amusing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a believer. I believe in God, my faith and my values. Aside from that I believe in people, my family, people I love and people who wants to add something significant to the world. I believe they can do the impossible to add value to themselves and the world. I believe in myself, alot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Above all I believe in God, because he adds the value and potential to people. So before you believe in others, believe in God first then yourself

                Legacy
            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            I hope I can be among the very few people who will make the world. I hope I can make the world a better place where people don't have to behave like stoneage men and be filled with ignorance and live a hardlife. I believe there is more to this life then just existing. We can live. We can live life to it's fullest while discovering why we all are on this earth. That dosen't mean there would not be bad days, bad days are a part of life and I hope I can teach people to go through those bad days and their problems without ending their life in the most tragic ways 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also another important legacy I would love to leave is the fact that people call me a believer. Yes I want to be called a believer and I also want to prove some people wrong. Those people that still say Africans and black are monkeys who will never learn. I am going to do that through tech and I am happy AltSchool Africa has come to the rescue.

       <p>
        The world is developing so fast. In this computering and technological era, most first world country seems to be so advanced and taking world class positions, I just feel like there is something I can add in the technological world and in this transition into another new era of technology, I want to be among the people who will add value to the world, I want to be among the people who will take technology to a new higher level, even if I am from a third world country, even if I have a semi standard foundation with how the web works and there came AltSchool. I believe AltSchool can bring out the genius in me, I believe AltSchool can light the sparkis in me and prepare me for the future of technology
